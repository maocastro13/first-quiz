My proposal to make the system secure is as follows:

# Security Proposal for Solar Panels, Inc.

## Introduction
At Solar Panels, Inc., we prioritize the security of our solar panel application infrastructure. We recognize the significance of safeguarding our critical assets, which include customer data, system integrity, and application availability. This proposal outlines our approach to ensure the security of our infrastructure.

## Identification of Critical Assets
Our most valuable assets include:
- Customer data, including passwords, addresses, and phone numbers.
- The integrity and availability of our applications and systems.

## Risks and Vulnerabilities
To address security, we have assessed risks and vulnerabilities using the OWASP Top 10 list as a guide. Here are the risks identified and the measures taken:
1. **SQL Injection**: We've secured our MySQL database against SQL injection by implementing parameterized queries and strict access control.
2. **Weak Authentication**: Our application now features enhanced authentication, including account lockouts and strong password policies.
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Sensitive data, like passwords, is securely stored using hashing and salting. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
4. **Access and Role Management**: We've established robust access and role management, minimizing the risk of privilege abuse.
5. **Protection of Sensitive Data in the Application**: Both our mobile app and web frontend are protected against common attacks. User inputs are carefully validated, and trusted security frameworks are used.

## Activity Monitoring and Logging
We've implemented a real-time monitoring and logging solution to swiftly detect anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

## Incident Response Plan
Our well-defined incident response plan includes notifications, mitigation procedures, and effective communication in case of a security breach.

## Employee Education and Awareness
Our employees receive regular training on security practices, secure password creation, and social engineering awareness, fostering a culture of security.

## Penetration Testing
Regular penetration tests are conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. These tests involve both internal teams and third-party security specialists.

## Legal Compliance
We adhere to all relevant data protection and privacy laws and regulations to ensure the privacy and security of customer data.

## Security Documentation
All security policies and procedures are documented in a company security manual, providing a clear reference for all employees and ensuring consistent implementation of security measures.

## Conclusion
Our top priority is the security of our assets and the trust of our customers. We remain committed to continually improving our security practices and adapting to evolving threats.
